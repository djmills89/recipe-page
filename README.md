## Overview

This was the first of the easy challenges on Frontend Mentor.  It was relatively easy, but I still learned a few things I did not know before.

## My process

I started this build by wrapping all of the copy in the appropriate HTML elements, defining the different sections and deciding what elements were most appropriate.  I then started designing it from the mobile size, ensuring my design was very similar to that of Frontend Mentors.  Then I worked on the large size to make sure it looked like the full screen example.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I used the ::marker psuedo-element to style bullet points and number separate from the text of the element for the first time.  

li::marker {
    color: var(--brown-800);
    font-weight: 600;
}

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan on trying to utilize units such as rem more in my CSS.
